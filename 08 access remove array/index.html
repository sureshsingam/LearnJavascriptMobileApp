		Adding and Removing Elements from Arrays

			weapons.push('knife', 'laser knife');

			//pop()

			//weapons.splice(1, 0, 'bomb', 'bow and arrow');
			/* So what the following command does is as follows:
			 * add items starting at position specified by the first argument
			 * , and while it is adding those items, it will replace the n amount of existing elements
			 *  identified by the second argument. Since we have two new elements to add, and the second argument is 2, this means that the
			 *  2 new elements will replace existing "laser gun" and "stick" with "artillery" and "nuclear".
			 *  edit: second argument refers to how many items to remove. If 0, no items are removed

			weapons.splice(1,2,'artillery',"nuclear");
			console.log(weapons);

			//If I want to only remove elements and not add them
			weapons.splice(1,3);
			console.log(weapons);
			/* What if we do not want to replace existing elements, but just want to add elements at
			the specified position in the array (and thereby extend the array length)*/
			weapons.splice(1,0,'Tank','Aeroplane');
